# Featured fixes

Fixes marked with ➕ are supported in 1.0, Steam, and Rockstar Games Launcher versions. Fixes without that symbol require 1.0.
Fixes marked with ⚙️ can be configured/toggled via the INI file. These options are enabled by default unless stated otherwise.

## Critical fixes
Compatibility issues, crashes, progression blockers.

* ➕ The 14ms frame delay has been removed. As a result, the game now locks properly on 30 FPS instead of 25 FPS.
* ➕ More precise frame limiter, reducing lag spikes a bit when playing with the Frame Limiter on.
* ➕ The mouse should not lock up randomly when exiting the menu on newer systems anymore.
* ➕ DirectPlay dependency has been removed - this should improve compatibility with Windows 8 and newer.
* ➕ Path to the User Files directory is now obtained using a dedicated API call rather than a legacy registry entry, future-proofing the games more.
* ➕ Fixed an issue that would cause games to freeze if III/VC/SA were running at the same time.
* ➕ Fixed an occasional crash when minimizing the game while standing next to a mirror.
* ➕ Fixed a crash on car explosions - most likely to happen when playing with a multi-monitor setup.
* ➕ Fixed a crash when entering advanced display options on a dual monitor machine after: starting the game on the primary monitor in maximum resolution, exiting, starting again in maximum resolution on the secondary monitor. The secondary monitor's maximum resolution had to be greater than the maximum resolution of the primary monitor (like in the 1.01 patch).
* ➕ Fixed a crash when entering Advanced Display Settings with 32MB VRAM (like in the 1.01 patch).
* ➕ Fixed an occasional crash occurring when standing next to escalators.
* ➕ Fixed a crash occurring when the vending machine was continuously used for an extended period.
* ➕ Fixed a streaming-related deadlock, which could occasionally result in the game being stuck on a black screen when entering or exiting interiors (this is the issue people used to fix by setting CPU affinity to one core).
* ➕ A significant memory leak when taking photos with an in-game camera has been fixed.
* ➕ Fixed a crash that occurred when mashing the replay button near groups of gang members holding items.
* ➕ Fixed a crash that occurred when starting a cutscene after playing a replay where CJ wore different clothes from what he is currently wearing.
* ➕ Fixed a crash that occurred when playing back a replay with CJ having a different body type (fat/muscular/normal) than his current one.
* ➕ Fixed Skimmer not spawning on Windows 11 24H2.
* ➕ The mouse cursor is now locked to the game window instead of getting re-centered constantly, so rapid mouse movements can no longer cause the cursor to leave the window in multi-monitor setups.
* ➕ Trains can now be saved in garages, and the game no longer crashes when spawning stored trains.
* Game timers now tick more accurately, making them not freeze if the framerate exceeds 1000 frames per second; in other words, this fixes occasional freezes on fadeouts if playing with the Frame Limiter off.
* A heap corruption in one place is now fixed (did not affect gameplay but could potentially make the game crash).
* Traveling far away from the map will no longer trigger the extra gang territories glitch, nor will it corrupt the Taxi Driver submission.
* A 1.0 no-DVD-only bug where recruiting gang members would stop working after activating a replay has been fixed (contributed by **Wesser**).
* Fixed a 1.01 only tiny memory leak which occurred every time the player switched a radio station.
* ➕ ⚙️ Made the game default to the desktop refresh rate instead of 60Hz, so Alt+Tab and startup no longer flicker on high refresh rate monitors.
* ⚙️ The gym glitch ("You have worked out enough..." showing infinitely) has been fixed.
* ⚙️ Saving in Madd Dogg's mansion will no longer trigger the missing basketball glitch.
* ⚙️ Fixed an occasional soft lock in "Mountain Cloud Boys" - the player will not freeze after arriving at the meeting anymore.
* ⚙️ Possible soft lock in "Sweet's Girl" initial cutscene fixed.
* ⚙️ Fixed a script error in how Driving and Bike Schools destroyed the cones used in lessons, where random objects from the map could be destroyed instead. This glitch was most famously known as the "Blackboard glitch" (contributed by **Wesser**).
* ⚙️ Fixed a script error in "Air Raid" where the player's heavy weapon (like a minigun) would disappear after the mission.

## Other fixes

* ➕ Dancing minigame timings have been improved, now they do not lose accuracy over time depending on the PC's uptime.

* ➕ Bombs in cars stored in garages now save properly.
* ➕ Streaming has been greatly improved during Supply Lines mission (or more general, any time when using an RC vehicle) - it now behaves as expected, as opposed to displaying LODs way too quickly.

* ➕ Script randomness is now 16-bit instead of 15-bit.
